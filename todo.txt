Textures
	Several planet textures (chosen randomly on init)
	Sun (& dwarf star?)
Make sun a light source
	Play around with attenuation etc
Spawn planetary system
	Sun in centre
	Planets spawning around
	Asteroids / moons spawning?
Distance between planets & planet sizes?
Control of spaceship
	Don't want self righting (maybe just the self righting on turn)
	Camera of spaceship needs to better follow
		Might happen automatically once ship controls are improved
