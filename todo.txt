Gravity may not be being applied correctly to ship
	Might need to just have 1 velocity, rather than ThrustMove and Velocity
	Velocity starts at 500,0,0, and must be adjusted as the pitch and yaw change
Afterburners for spaceship
	Use up fuel, gain fuel over time
	UI element
	Speedometer as well
Improve moon spawning
	Have number of moons spawning around a planet be based on the planet's size?
	Closer to sun means the moon needs to spawn closer to the planet it orbits so the sun doesn't pull it out of orbit
		Or just need min distance from sun in order for moons to spawn
Better looking spaceship
	New mesh
	New texture
	Engine animation, growing as the ship gets faster, or maybe just while accelerating
Gravity should be stronger?


Camera control of spaceship
	May want to make the camera not follow the ship's rotation while the the camera is being manually controlled
	Maybe control the spaceship by dragging right click

DONE:
	Played around with spaceship control to suit the space environtment
		A & D to adjust roll
		Q & E to adjust yaw
		Removed self-righting of roll
	Played around with camera control
		Small amount of lag added to give more of a sense of speed, so distance between camera and spaceship increases as the spaceship's speed increases
		Small amount of rotation lag to give a better sense of how the spaceship is moving
		Player can manually control the camera by holding LMB and dragging the mouse. The camera rotates about the spaceship and will move back to its default position when LMB is released
	Gravity is now applied to the spaceship
