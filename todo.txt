Spawn planetary system
	Sun in centre
		Need to be able to specify what type of body a ASphereActor is
		Need more realistic sizes and masses 
	Planets spawning around
	Asteroids / moons spawning?
	Play around with spawning orbit velocities / G constant to make orbits more stable
	Calculated orbit velocities should be affected by the velocity of the central body
Distance between planets & planet sizes?
Control of spaceship
	Don't want self righting (maybe just the self righting on turn)
	Camera of spaceship needs to better follow
		Might happen automatically once ship controls are improved
Apply gravity to spaceship
