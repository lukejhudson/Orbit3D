Control of spaceship
	Don't want self righting (maybe just the self righting on turn)
	Camera of spaceship needs to better follow
		Might happen automatically once ship controls are improved
Apply gravity to spaceship
Afterburners for spaceship
	Use up fuel, gain fuel over time
	UI element
Improve moon spawning
	Have number of moons spawning around a planet be based on the planet's size?
	Closer to sun means the moon needs to spawn closer to the planet it orbits so the sun doesn't pull it out of orbit
		Or just need min distance from sun in order for moons to spawn

DONE:
	Fixed bug that made the spawning velocity much too low - Initial orbit velocity is now correct and much more visually accurate
	Initial orbit velocities are now affected by the velocity of the central body
	A random number of moons (0-3) now spawn in orbit around each planet within a planetary system
	All spheres now have an axis that is rotated between 0 and 180 degrees, and the sphere rotate about this axis at a random speed
